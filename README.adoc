Based on the project https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-batch-processing.git this project works with two postgres databases.
One database stores spring batch data and the another stores the application data.

It's designed to work on postgres 9.4.

You will need to create two databases.
One of them must be created using the script people_database.sql.
The another can be an empty datase as the spring batch will create all the necessary tables.
